Portion Website – Child Nutrition Awareness Platform

The Portion Website is an educational web platform developed to address child malnutrition and school dropouts in parts of Bengal and North India, where lack of proper nutrition is a major concern.
This project was built as part of a hackathon with the goal of creating awareness among parents about nutritious, affordable food portions suitable for children.

The website helps parents understand what kind of healthy food they can provide to their children, focusing on balanced nutrition using locally available ingredients. By spreading awareness about proper nutrition, the platform aims to indirectly reduce dropism caused by health and energy deficiencies.
